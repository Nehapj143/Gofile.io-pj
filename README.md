# GoFile Uploader Telegram Bot

A Telegram bot that uploads files and media to [gofile.io](https://gofile.io). This bot is built using Pyrogram and is designed to handle media and document uploads from Telegram and store them on gofile.io.

## Features

- Upload files to gofile.io via Telegram
- Supports direct URL uploads
- Optionally specify token and folder ID for uploads
- Provides direct download link from gofile.io

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- A Telegram bot token from [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather)
- gofile.io account (optional for token and folder ID)

## Setup

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gofile-uploader-telegram-bot.git
cd gofile-uploader-telegram-bot
```

### Create a Virtual Environment

It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your bot token, API ID, and API hash. Optionally, specify the port.

```
BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here
API_ID=your_api_id_here
API_HASH=your_api_hash_here
PORT=5000  # Optional
```

### Running the Bot

You can run the bot locally using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Deploying to Render

1. **Sign up on [Render](https://render.com)**.
2. **Create a New Web Service**:
    - Select GitHub as your repository source.
    - Choose your repository and branch.
    - Add the required environment variables (`BOT_TOKEN`, `API_ID`, `API_HASH`) in the Render dashboard.
    - Click "Deploy".

## Usage

Once the bot is running, you can use the following commands in Telegram:

- `/start`: Get instructions on how to use the bot.
- `/upload`: Upload a file or media. You can use this command in several ways:
    - Reply to a media message with `/upload` to upload the media.
    - Use `/upload url` to upload a file from a URL.
    - Use `/upload token` to upload a file with a token.
